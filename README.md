## Description

The objective of this project is to generate a simple logo for projects.
The goal was to create logo faster by imposing text on top of a colored shape.
We wanted to limit the characters up to 3 we have decided most things could be a three letter acronym (TLA).
But also because we wanted to make sure the shapes were uniformly bound to a 300x200 size
